# Default Starter Kit for Rust

[![Deploy to Fastly](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/button)](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/deploy)

Get to know the Fastly Compute environment with a basic starter that demonstrates routing, simple synthetic responses and code comments that cover common patterns.

**For more details about this and other starter kits for Compute, see the [Fastly Developer Hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters/)**.

## Features

- Allow only requests with particular HTTP methods
- Match request URL path and methods for routing
- Build synthetic responses at the edge

## Understanding the code

This starter is intentionally lightweight, and requires no dependencies aside from the [`fastly`](https://docs.rs/fastly) crate. It will help you understand the basics of processing requests at the edge using Fastly. This starter includes implementations of common patterns explained in our [using Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/rust/) and [VCL migration](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/migrate/) guides.

The starter doesn't require the use of any backends. Once deployed, you will have a Fastly service running on Compute that can generate synthetic responses at the edge.
